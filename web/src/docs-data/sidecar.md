p2p.kiwi ships an Odin helper (`p2p-kiwi-sidecar`) for always-on-top,
click-through cursor overlays. Electron main is the only process that
starts it. The renderer never executes sidecar commands.

## Capabilities

The sidecar reports what the current desktop can do instead of making
the UI branch on OS names:

- `overlays` - native overlay windows are available
- `clickThrough` - overlays ignore pointer input
- `displayEnumeration` - display list/bounds are available
- `pointerInjection` / `keyboardInjection` - OS input injection is
  available for remote control
- `emergencyHotkey` - the sidecar-native emergency stop is registered
- `keyboardCapture` - exclusive keyboard grab on the **controlling**
  peer so chords reach the host instead of local menus / the compositor
- `globalKeyboardObservation` - physical emergency-chord observation
  (required on Wayland together with injection)
- Permission probes (`accessibility`, `screenRecording`,
  `inputMonitoring`) are reported without prompting unless the user
  explicitly requests Accessibility from the UI

Remote control stays **disarmed by default**. The sidecar never
auto-restores an armed state after restart, IPC loss, or emergency stop.
If injection or the emergency hotkey is unavailable, capabilities stay
false and the app continues without remote control.

If `overlays` is false, p2p.kiwi keeps the existing Electron cursor
window. Calls still work.

## Linux compositor notes

Wayland and X11 are separate backends. Capabilities include an optional
`backend` field (`wayland`, `x11`, or `none`).

**Wayland (preferred):** `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` overlay layer, no keyboard
interactivity, `exclusive_zone = 0`, and an empty `wl_surface` input
region re-applied on every commit. This is the koverlay-equivalent path
on compositors that implement layer-shell (KWin, Hyprland, Sway, and
similar). The sidecar measures `wl_output` itself. Electron bounds only
select which output. The layer is that output's logical size
(`mode / scale`). The cursor buffer is the mode size, in physical
pixels. `wp_viewporter` maps that buffer onto the logical surface.
Without a viewporter, the integer output scale is `wl_surface` buffer
scale.

**X11 / XWayland (GNOME and other non-layer-shell sessions):**
override-redirect notification window, empty Shape/XFixes input region
after map, ARGB visual. Weaker than layer-shell: stacking and
click-through are best-effort, and XWayland passthrough is compositor-
dependent. Used only when layer-shell is missing but `DISPLAY` works.
The window and cursor bitmap are the RandR CRTC rectangle, not
Electron's logical bounds. A 1920×1080 hint still matches a 3840×2160
CRTC when that is the X screen, including when Electron reports
`scaleFactor` 1. If RandR returns no matching CRTC, the hint rectangle
is used.

There is no fallback to global input grabs. If neither layer-shell nor
X11 is usable, `overlays` is false and Electron keeps the cursor window.

PipeWire/xdg-desktop-portal are used only for screen capture in
Electron. They are not used to draw overlays.

## Windows

Layered, non-activating, topmost tool window
(`WS_EX_LAYERED | WS_EX_TRANSPARENT | WS_EX_NOACTIVATE | WS_EX_TOPMOST | WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`).
The process is per-monitor DPI aware. Electron bounds only select
which monitor. The layered window and the cursor bitmap are that
monitor's `rcMonitor`, in physical pixels, including when Electron
reports `scaleFactor` 1. If no monitor matches, the window falls back
to `bounds * scaleFactor`. Display hot-plug remaps the overlay without
restarting the sidecar.

## macOS

Borderless transparent `NSWindow` at `NSPopUpMenuWindowLevel`,
`ignoresMouseEvents`, no activation, and `NSWindowSharingNone` so the
overlay is not part of the captured screen. The window frame is the matched `NSScreen` frame, in Cocoa points
(bottom-left, y-up), including negative origins for displays left of
or below the primary display. Electron bounds only select which
screen. The bitmap and `contentsScale` use that screen's
`backingScaleFactor`, so Retina cursors stay sharp even when Electron
reports scale 1. If no screen matches, the frame falls back to the
Electron bounds. A display
reconfiguration hides the overlay until the next update, instead of
leaving it on the previous monitor. Lock screen and some fullscreen
Spaces are not covered; the helper does not try to draw over them.

Remote input uses Quartz `CGEventPost`. That needs Accessibility
(`CGRequestPostEventAccess`). The emergency stop is a listen-only event
tap for the configured chord, which needs Input Monitoring
(`CGRequestListenEventAccess`). The tap does not record other local
keys. Overlay drawing does not request either permission. Probes never
prompt; Settings and the session UI ask only after a click, and they
name the helper macOS will show: **p2p.kiwi Sidecar**
(`kiwi.p2p.desktop.sidecar`). If macOS still reports access as missing
after you approve it, quit p2p.kiwi and open it again.

While a mouse button is held, moves are posted as drag events. Secure
input (password fields and similar) is reported as a failure instead of
being bypassed. If the emergency tap is disabled by timeout or by
revoked listen permission, both grants are cleared immediately.

## Remote input

The sidecar protocol version is **2**. Renderer and Electron main own
peer authorization. Odin owns only:

- armed / allow pointer / allow keyboard
- the armed `sessionId`, `peerId`, and `grantEpoch`, when Electron sends
  them; events for another session, peer, or epoch are rejected
- injection of sanitized desktop coordinates and portable key ids
- tracking of keys/buttons it injected, and `release-all`
- the physical emergency hotkey (`Ctrl+Esc` by default)
- exclusive keyboard capture on the controlling peer
  (`keyboard-capture-arm` / `captured-key`); mouse still comes from the
  renderer video element. Capture forwards Ctrl+Esc like any other key.
  Only the host's physical keyboard stops remote control.

Emergency disable order inside Odin, without waiting for Electron:

1. latch capture + injection (`emergency_generation`); queued arm
   requests without that generation are rejected
2. `armed = false`
3. release every remotely-held key and button
4. emit `remote-control-disabled` with `generation`

Ctrl+Esc is observed from evdev on each real keyboard. When every
keyboard node is readable, X11 key events are not treated as the chord,
so XTest and XWayland echoes of injected keys cannot stop control. On a
pure X11 session with no readable evdev node, the chord comes from
XInput raw events that ignore the XTEST keyboard. XTest injects via
`XKeysymToKeycode`, not a hardcoded evdev+8 offset.

### Platform backends

- **Windows:** `SendInput` with `MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE |
MOUSEEVENTF_VIRTUALDESK`. The emergency chord is a low-level keyboard
  hook that ignores injected keys (`LLKHF_INJECTED`).
- **macOS:** CoreGraphics event posts after Accessibility is granted.
  Emergency stop is a listen-only event tap and needs Input Monitoring.
  The helper does not capture the screen.
- **Linux X11:** XTest injection. The emergency chord is evdev when every
  keyboard is readable, otherwise XInput raw events that ignore the XTEST
  keyboard. Controller-side capture uses `EVIOCGRAB` when evdev is readable,
  otherwise `XGrabKeyboard`.
- **Linux Wayland:** XTest through XWayland. Arming control posts one
  motion event at the pointer's current position so GNOME opens the
  Remote Desktop dialog ("Allow remote interaction"). Until that is
  shared, injected input does not reach the session. The emergency
  chord is still evdev on the physical keyboard, so XWayland echoes of
  injected keys are not the chord. Remote control arms when XTest works
  and at least one keyboard event node is readable. A keyboard the
  sidecar cannot open (typically the laptop keyboard, mode `660` group
  `input`) cannot raise the chord itself; keyboards that did open still
  can. The Arch package installs the rule to `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`
  and reloads udev. A `.deb` install copies it to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`.
  Sign in again so the built-in keyboard is tagged `uaccess` for the
  active session. Do not run the sidecar as root, and do not make
  keyboard nodes mode `666`. If X11 cannot be opened, injection falls
  back to a `/dev/uinput` device named `p2p-kiwi-remote`. That device
  is ignored while watching evdev so injected keys cannot trip the
  chord, and it does not open the GNOME dialog. Controller-side capture
  requires an evdev `EVIOCGRAB`; XGrabKeyboard is not treated as success
  on Wayland sessions.
- **Linux hybrid (common):** many Wayland sessions still report overlay
  `backend: x11` (XWayland / no layer-shell). The overlay window is the
  RandR CRTC for the shared display. Electron bounds only identify
  which CRTC. Input uses the same XTest path as Wayland above.

Logs record event types and counters only, never key identities or
typed text.

## Packaging

The binary is an electron-builder extra resource
(`resources/sidecar/p2p-kiwi-sidecar` or `.exe` on Windows), not inside
asar. If the binary is missing (for example Linux arm64 cross-builds),
the app starts without native overlays.

macOS release builds ship a universal (`arm64` + `x86_64`) helper app at
`Contents/Helpers/p2p.kiwi Sidecar.app`. It is signed on its own, with
hardened runtime and an empty entitlement set, before the outer app is
sealed. Electron keeps the JIT, camera, and microphone entitlements.
GitHub Actions on `macos-latest` runs `codesign`, entitlement checks,
and `lipo` on every macOS build. The release job also runs
`spctl --assess` and `xcrun stapler validate` after notarization.
Local `sidecar:dev` builds remain a host-arch binary under
`native/overlay-sidecar/dist`.

## Phase A acceptance gate

Phase A is complete when all of the following hold. Cryptography in
Phase B must not start from a sidecar that fails this gate.

- Packaged app starts on Windows, macOS, and Linux with or without the
  sidecar binary
- Protocol version mismatch fails closed for native overlays
- Overlay click-through does not steal focus
- Cursor updates stay smooth (coalesced; renderer is not blocked)
- Display hot-plug or `changeScreen()` remaps the overlay in place
- Peer disconnect, leave, or kick clears that peer's overlay cursor
- Killing the sidecar process does not end the call
- Sidecar restart restores current overlay cursors
- The sidecar has no TCP or other network listener
- Remote control is capability-gated and fail-closed
- Electron cursor window remains the fallback when overlays are
  unavailable
